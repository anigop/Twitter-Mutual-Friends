Builds a graph from the JSON input file, which denotes a user. Then iteratively computes top 3 "Most likely" friends who are friend's of friends.

Tested on 10,000 fake users.



Convert.py reads the original json input file and makes the integers strings, for java
to use, since the integers were too big to fit into "int".

I have run the code using sampledata.json file, with 10,000 nodes, and dumped the json output to output-top3.json file.

The code defaults to reading inputs-large.json file and accepts the first argument as a filename if provided.
